SELECT is the clause you use every time you want to query information from a database.
WHERE is a popular command that lets you filter the results of the query based on conditions that you specify.
LIKE and BETWEEN are special operators that can be used in a WHERE clause
AND and OR are special operators that you can use with WHERE to filter the query on two or more conditions.
ORDER BY lets you sort the results of the query in either ascending or descending order.
LIMIT lets you specify the maximum number of rows that the query will return. This is especially important in large tables that have thousands or even millions of rows.

------------------- Subqueries are used to complete an SQL transformation by nesting one query within another query.

- A non-correlated subquery is a subquery that can be run independently of the outer query and can be used to complete a multi-step transformation.

- A correlated subquery is a subquery that cannot be run independently of the outer query. The order of operations in a correlated subquery is as follows:

1. A row is processed in the outer query.

2. Then, for that particular row in the outer query, the subquery is executed. ----------------------
